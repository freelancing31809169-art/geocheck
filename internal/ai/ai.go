// Package ai answers whether the model providers' APIs will talk to this
// address, which is a different question from whether their consumer websites
// will.
//
// The websites sit behind bot protection: claude.ai and gemini.google.com hand
// out Cloudflare challenges to anything that is not a browser, so a check
// against them is inconclusive on exactly the hosts people most want to test.
// The APIs have no such defence, and they answer in their own vocabulary.
//
// That vocabulary is what these checks read, and it makes an unauthenticated
// probe useful:
//
//   - an authentication error means the request reached the service. It looked
//     at the credentials and found them missing, which it can only do after
//     deciding it is willing to serve the caller at all.
//   - a refusal naming the region means the opposite, and says so outright:
//     OpenAI answers "unsupported_country_region_territory", Anthropic answers
//     "Request not allowed".
//
// So no API key is needed to learn the thing worth knowing. A key would only
// upgrade "reachable" to "usable", which is a question about the account
// rather than about the network.
//
// The verdict is deliberately "reachable" rather than "available": without
// credentials the check proves the endpoint answers and does not refuse this
// region, and stops short of claiming the service would actually serve a
// request.
